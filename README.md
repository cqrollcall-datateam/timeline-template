# CQRC Tik Tok Timeline Template

Use this template to get a head start on all your timeline needs.

This package includes all styles needed to match the first timeline created with Tik Tok. The index calls Tik Tok and Tabletop.JS.


### Using a Google Sheet

To pull content in to a timeline via Google Sheets, replace the `key` in `main.js` with the Sheets key of the Sheet you'll be using. (This normally comes after the `/d/` in the URL. 

See the [Tabletop section of the documentation](https://datanews.github.io/tik-tok/examples/example-tabletop.html) for help.

See [Tik Tok documentation](https://datanews.github.io/tik-tok) and [examples](https://datanews.github.io/tik-tok/examples/) for more. Note that examples are more docs and options for extending the app!
